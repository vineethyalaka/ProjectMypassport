<p>At NJIT, we are committed to fostering opportunities for students to share their skills, talents and enthusiasm through service for the benefit of our communities.  Through the civic engagement programs in CDS, our students have become an invaluable resource of both technical and non-technical help for local and regional agencies.  We link students, alumni, faculty, and staff directly to community service activities with non-profit organizations located in and around Newark, and throughout the state of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Through both volunteer and paid service opportunities, students assist public and non-profit agencies in meeting their objectives to help improve the quality of life in our communities.  Participants in these programs have become an invaluable resource of both technical and non-technical help for local and regional agencies.</p>

<p> Studies show that students who are involved on campus and participate in service activities are more successful 
    academically and are better prepared to enter the workforce and graduate professional schools.</p>

<p>NJIT prepares its graduates for positions of leadership  as professionals and as citizens. Our mission identifies NJIT as the states technological research university , committed to the pursuit of excellence - - in service to 
    both its environment urban environment and the broader society. </p>
